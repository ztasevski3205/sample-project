description: >-
  Creates and maintains the single source of truth about the business — who the customers are, what problem is being solved, and what the product does. Run once after the client interview to create the file, then update it whenever the strategy changes. Everything the team builds is anchored to this document.
  Use when the operator says "update product.md" or "document the product", or right after pm-client-interview completes.

# PM: Product Documentation

Manages exactly **one file**: `docs/product/product.md`.

Epics, epic-status, and timeline are owned by other skills:
- `docs/product/epics.md` → **pm-epic-writing**
- `docs/product/epic-status.md` → **pm-epic-writing**

## File: `docs/product/product.md`

Header: `{product name} · Written by {Owner} · Draft v0.1 · {date}`

Framing sentence (first line): *"If you can read this whole document and not be able to tell a stranger why we'd be sad if this product didn't exist, I've failed at writing it."*

Sections in this exact order:

1. `## 1. The problem` — two paragraphs: first states the problem with numbers/evidence; second names the broken assumption. End with "If we're wrong about this, no amount of feature work saves us."
2. `## 2. What we deliver` — N bold verb-noun phrases (max 6), each with a one-sentence explanation
3. `## 3. Who this is for` — 3-paragraph narrative: (a) vivid portrait of the specific person, (b) what they've tried and rejected, (c) 3 anti-personas
4. `## 4. The job they're hiring us for` — two paragraphs: JTBD in behavioral terms; what they go back to if product vanishes
5. `## 5. The wedge` — one feature/mechanism in bold + 3 bullets on why it's specific/deterministic/compounds
6. `## 6. 12 months out` — 3–5 paragraphs walking through the mature product
7. `## 7. What we are explicitly not building` — 4–6 bold categories with one-sentence explanations
8. `## 8. Differentiation table` — Competitor | What they do well | Where they fall short | Our angle (≥3 rows)
9. `## 9. Market and timing` — TAM/SAM/SOM + why now
10. `## 10. Business model` — pricing, unit economics
11. `## 11. What I believe but can't yet prove` — 2–4 load-bearing assumptions, each with falsification test
12. `## 12. How we know it's working` — 2 metrics only: Leading metric + Trailing metric
13. `## 13. Next 90 days` — 3 bets in "end-state, not roadmap" format
14. `## 14. Open decisions` — bulleted: what's undecided + who decides + deadline

Close: `---` then *"What this doc deliberately does not do: feature backlog, integration list, P&L."*
