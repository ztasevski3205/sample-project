  Enforces test-first development — write a failing test first, then write only the minimum code needed to make it pass, then clean up. This catches bugs early and ensures every feature ships with test coverage. Use when building anything that needs to be reliable.

# Dev TDD

Strict red-green-refactor. No exceptions.

## The Law

1. **Red first.** Write a failing test before writing any implementation code.
2. **Green minimal.** Write the minimum code to make the test pass — nothing more.
3. **Refactor clean.** Clean up with all tests green. Do not add features during refactor.

Repeat. One cycle at a time. No skipping steps.

## Hard Rules

- **No implementation without a failing test.** If you write code before a test, stop. Delete the code. Write the test first.
- **No horizontal slicing.** Do not build "the data layer" then "the business layer" then "the UI layer". Build one complete vertical slice (input → output) at a time, tested end-to-end.
- **No green shortcuts.** Do not hard-code return values to pass tests (unless as a deliberate step in triangulation — but you must write another test that forces real logic within the same cycle).
- **Test must fail for the right reason.** Before writing implementation, confirm the test fails with the expected failure message — not a wrong error. One exception: the first test of a brand-new module can only fail on the missing import; that counts as red. From the second test on, the failure must be an assertion.

## Vertical Slice Pattern

Each TDD cycle targets one user-visible behaviour:

```
TEST: "given {input}, {system} produces {output}"
IMPL: minimal code to satisfy the test
REFACTOR: clean without changing behaviour
```

Examples of vertical slices:
- "Given a valid email, signup returns a user ID"
- "Given an invalid email, signup returns a 400 with a message"
- NOT: "Build the User model" (horizontal)

## Running tests vs. running a dev server

These are different things — do not confuse them:

| What | Command example | Allowed? |
|---|---|---|
| Run the test suite | `npm test`, `npx jest`, `npx vitest` | ✅ Yes — always |
| Run E2E tests (headless) | `npx playwright test` | ✅ Yes |
| Start a dev server | `npm run dev`, `next dev` | ❌ No — use Vercel preview instead |

TDD requires running tests. Running `npm test` is not "starting a localhost server" — it is a process that exits when finished. You can and should run it at every red/green/refactor step.

## Cycle Discipline

```
1. Write test → run → confirm RED (right failure)
2. Write impl → run → confirm GREEN
3. Refactor → run → confirm still GREEN
4. Commit the slice on the feature branch, files staged by name — `test: {behaviour}`
   then `feat: {behaviour}`. An approved plan item is the operator's instruction to
   commit there (`developer.md`, Git workflow); what `global-engineering.md` forbids is
   an unrequested commit and any commit on `main`.
5. Next slice
```

## Gate

Before calling a feature done:

- [ ] Every behaviour has at least one test.
- [ ] No implementation code exists without a corresponding test.
- [ ] All tests pass.
- [ ] No test is skipped, commented out, or marked `.only` without reason.
- [ ] Each test targets a specific acceptance criterion from `.specify/features/{slug}/spec.md` (cite it in the test name or a comment — e.g. `// AC-3: user receives confirmation email`).
